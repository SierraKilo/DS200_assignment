1.  Perform some basic analysis using Google Colab on datasets select from https://data.gov.in/. 
2.  Create these relevant plots using MatPlotLib:
    (a)  Scatter plot
	  (b)  Box plot
		(c)  Bar or line plot
3.  Create public github repo for your data science project
4.  Upload the plots and the Python scripts you wrote to this repository 
5.  Include a Readme.md documentation for the same listing the data sources, the observations and analysis from the plots, including citations.
6.  Upload a link to the public github repo on MS Form

**Data Source:** The data set has been taken from https://data.gov.in/files/ogdpv2dms/s3fs-public/datafile/Annex_7.4_RTYB_2006-2015.csv and depicts the Sales of Motor Vehicles in India Including Exports from 2006-07 to 2014-15.
 
**Observations & Analysis:**
  
1.  Inference from Scatter Plot - The sales of Motorcycles, scooters and passenger cars have been increasing during the period of our analysis. However, the sales of other vehicles have been constant during the period of our analysis. Further, the sales of motorcycles have been the highest amongst all the vehicles and are almost 5 times the sales of scooters/ passenger cars which are the second-most sold vehicles.

2.  Inference from Box Plot - From the Box plot, we can infer that the Inter Quartile Range represented by the height of the box plot is more for the sale of Motorcycles, Scooters and Passenger Cars, whereas it is minimal for all other vehicle types with the IQR of Electric Two-Wheelers and M&HCVs being the minimum.

3.  Inference from Bar Plot - The sales of Motorcycles, scooters and passenger cars have been increasing during the period of our analysis. However, the sales of other vehicles have been constant during the period of our analysis. Further, the sales of motorcycles have been the highest amongst all the vehicles and are almost 5 times the sales of scooters/ passenger cars which are the second-most sold vehicles. It can also be inferred that the sales of Electric Two-Wheelers have not picked up during the period of analysis.

4.  Inference from Line Plot - The sales of Motorcycles, scooters and passenger cars have been increasing during the period of our analysis. However, the sales of other vehicles have been constant during the period of our analysis. Further, the sales of motorcycles have been the highest amongst all the vehicles and are almost 5 times the sales of scooters/ passenger cars which are the
second-most sold vehicles. It can also be inferred that post 2011-12, the sales of passenger cars have taken a slight dip.
